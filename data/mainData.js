      "Domestic dogs have been companions to people for more than 15,000 years. There are more than 400 different breeds of dogs. PAWS or your local animal shelter has a wide variety of breeds available for adoption. The most popular types are the non-pedigree. They are extra special because they are one-of-a-kind!",
      "In general, small dogs live longer than large dogs. Small dogs such as terriers may live 20 years. Giant dogs like Great Danes may live eight years. The average lifespan for a mixed breed dog is 13 to 14 years. By making sure dogs have good food, regular veterinary care, shelter and a loving family, they will live longer, healthier lives.",
